# Cardiac Risk Prediction using Classical Machine Learning Techniques  

This repository contains the **code and report** for the project **“Cardiac Risk Prediction using Classical Machine Learning Techniques”**, developed for the **Machine Learning** course at the **University of Coimbra (2024/2025)**.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to **predict cardiac risk from clinical data** using **supervised machine learning algorithms**.  
The study evaluates several **classical models** with and without **data balancing (SMOTE)** to analyze their sensitivity, specificity, and overall predictive power for identifying high-risk patients.  

A special focus was placed on **sensitivity** — the most critical metric in medical diagnosis — to ensure that high-risk patients are correctly identified, even if it slightly increases false positives.  

## Available Files  
- **`P1_cardiacRisk.py`** – Complete Python implementation, including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and statistical tests.  
- **`ReportMartinusBoomUc2024154464.pdf`** – Full report explaining dataset preparation, modeling, results, and discussion.  

**The dataset (`cardiacRisk.csv`) is NOT included in this repository** due to privacy and licensing restrictions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, NumPy, Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib, SciPy**  
- **Statistical Testing:** Friedman test, Wilcoxon-Holm correction
